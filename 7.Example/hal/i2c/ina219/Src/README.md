## LibDriver INA219

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/ina219/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The INA219 is a current shunt and power monitor with an I2C- or SMBUS-compatible interface. The device monitors both shunt voltage drop and bus supply voltage, with programmable conversion times and filtering. A programmable calibration value, combined with an internal multiplier, enables direct readouts of current in amperes. An additional multiplying register calculates power in watts. The I2C- or SMBUS-compatible interface features 16 programmable addresses.The INA219 senses across shunts on buses that can vary from 0 to 26 V. The device uses a single 3- to 5.5-V supply, drawing a maximum of 1 mA of supply current.This chip can be used in servers,telecom equipment,notebook computers,power management,battery chargers,welding equipment,power supplies,test equipment and so on.

LibDriver INA219 is the full function driver of INA219 launched by LibDriver.It provides continuous mode reading, single mode reading, current acquisition, voltage acquisition and power acquisition.LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Usage

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_ina219_basic.h"

uint8_t res;

res = ina219_basic_init(INA219_ADDRESS_0, 0.1);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    float mV;
    float mA;
    float mW;

    res = ina219_basic_read(&mV, &mA, &mW);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)ina219_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, times);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: bus voltage is %0.3fmV.\n", mV);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: current is %0.3fmA.\n", mA);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: power is %0.3fmW.\n", mW);
    ina219_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...

(void)ina219_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_ina219_shot.h"

uint8_t res;

res = ina219_shot_init(INA219_ADDRESS_0, 0.1);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    float mV;
    float mA;
    float mW;

    res = ina219_shot_read(&mV, &mA, &mW);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)ina219_shot_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, times);
    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: bus voltage is %0.3fmV.\n", mV);

    ina219_interface_debug_print("ina219: power is %0.3fmW.\n", mW);
    ina219_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
}

...

(void)ina219_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
